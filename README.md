There are:
1. Simulated Annealing algorithm for continous problem (can be high-dimensional) and combinatorial optimization problem (such as Quadratic Assignment problem).
2. Genetic Algorithm for continous problem (can be high-dimensional) and combinatorial optimization problem.
3. Improved Bayesian Optimization algorithm: A algorithm improved by myself based on the original Bayesian Optimization algorithm, which is used for solving the dynamic, time-series, and nonlinear SEIR optimal control problem with non-convext objective function in my PhD research.
4. Imrpoved Bayesian Optimization algorithm by combining dimension reduciton and dimension fill-in: A algorithm improved by myself based on my last improved Bayesian Optimization algorithm, which is used for solving the dynamic, time-series, high-dimensional and nonlinear SEIR optimal control problem with non-convext objective function in my PhD research.
5. Some small examples: Minimize the waiting time in queue;
